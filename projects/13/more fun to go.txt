See Chapter 13. It's your call!

And, if you develop something cool, please let us know about it.

We hope that you enjoyed the course!

Žarko's call: High-Performance Hack Emulator

The course emulator runs at ~50K instructions/second, making HackTrader's
real-time market making impractical. The natural next step: build a
high-performance Hack CPU + VM emulator targeting 500 MHz - 1 GHz throughput.

Planned implementation:
- Dual implementations in Rust 2024 and C++20/23
- Threaded interpreter or AOT compilation
- Latency instrumentation (P50/P99 histograms)
- Deterministic replay for debugging
- Optional: FPGA implementation on iCE40

This extends the "NAND to Operating System" journey into "NAND to
High-Performance Computing" — demonstrating that the hardware we built
from first principles can run at practical speeds with proper engineering
